    description: "The Haval Jolion HEV is the hybrid variant of Great Wall Motor's compact crossover SUV, representing the company's expansion into electrified powertrains for global markets. Built on GWM's L.E.M.O.N. platform (B30), it shares its modern, stylish exterior design with the conventional Jolion while featuring a distinct front-end design unique to the hybrid variant, including modified headlights, turn signals, front bumper, front grille and rear bumper. The hybrid powertrain combines a 1.5L turbocharged four-cylinder engine (GW4G15H) with an electric motor for a combined output of 140 kW (190 hp) and 375 Nm of torque, paired with a dedicated hybrid transmission (DHT115). This power-split hybrid system allows for pure electric driving at low speeds, with the gasoline engine engaging when more power is needed. The interior features a 12.3-inch central touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and satellite navigation, along with a 7.0-inch instrument display and optional head-up display. Standard technology includes wireless smartphone charging, dual-zone climate control with PM2.5 air filter, and a six-speaker sound system. The Jolion HEV delivers fuel efficiency of approximately 5.0L/100km in combined driving conditions, significantly better than its conventional counterpart. As one of the more affordable hybrid SUVs in many markets, the Jolion HEV has helped strengthen Haval's international presence, particularly in Australia, South Africa, Southeast Asia, and other export markets where production continues since 2021."
