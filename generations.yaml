    description: "The Haval Jolion HEV is the hybrid variant of Great Wall Motor's compact crossover SUV, representing the company's expansion into electrified powertrains for global markets. Built on GWM's Lemon platform, it shares its modern, stylish exterior design with the conventional Jolion, featuring a bold front grille, LED lighting, and a floating roof effect created by blacked-out pillars. The hybrid powertrain combines a 1.5L turbocharged four-cylinder engine with an electric motor for a combined output of approximately 190 HP (140 kW) and 375 Nm of torque, paired with a dedicated hybrid transmission (DHT). This system allows for pure electric driving at low speeds and in specific conditions, with the gasoline engine engaging when more power is needed. The interior features a contemporary design centered around a 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster and a 12.3-inch central touchscreen, with minimal physical buttons and a focus on digital interfaces. Standard technology includes wireless smartphone charging, voice control, and a comprehensive suite of driver assistance systems under the brand's ADAS package. The Jolion HEV delivers significantly improved fuel efficiency compared to its conventional counterpart, typically achieving around 5.0L/100km in combined driving conditions. This model represents Haval's efforts to meet increasingly stringent global emissions regulations while offering consumers the practicality of an SUV with reduced operating costs. As one of the more affordable hybrid SUVs in many markets, the Jolion HEV has helped strengthen Haval's international presence, particularly in regions like Australia, South Africa, and parts of Southeast Asia where it competes with established Japanese and Korean brands by offering comparable technology and features at a more accessible price point."
